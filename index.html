            <p>
                In recent years, evolutionary computation has been extensively utilized to find effective solutions to a
                wide range of computationally difficult problems for which ad hoc heuristics may not exist. Novel
                nature-inspired algorithms have been introduced and are effectively applied to real-world challenges
                with the advent of evolutionary algorithms. As a subfield of computational intelligence, evolutionary
                artificial intelligence uses computational models of evolutionary processes as the key element in design
                and implementation. Many evolutionary computational models have been proposed, including evolutionary
                algorithms, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and swarm intelligence. These techniques form
                the basis of several emerging disciplines like artificial life and evolutionary robotics. Despite the
                fact that the area is well-established and has reached a mature level of growth, significant research
                breakthroughs are presented every year by either suggesting new approaches or enhancing certain elements
                of well-known algorithms. This 2nd International Conference on Evolutionary Artificial
                Intelligence (ICEAI 2024) intends to be a major forum for engineers and research practitioners
                interested in the study, design, analysis, modeling, and implementation of evolvable systems both
                theoretical and application fields. ICEAI 2024 also aims to foster hybrid approaches within evolutionary
                computation by integrating fuzzy computation and neural computation technologies.

        <h1>About SR University</h1>
        <p>
            Sri Rajeshwara Educational Society, the parent body of SR University is a 45-year-old conglomerate of
            educational institutions with more than 90,000 students and 10,000 teaching and non-teaching staff members.
            SR Educational Academy governs 95 Educational Institutions across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
            The goal of SR University is to create an innovative learning educational ecosystem whose graduates
            significantly contribute to the growth of Telangana and India. We plan to transform the educational system
            through three key differentiators.At the core of SRU, exceptional faculty engage students in new experiences
            through innovative teaching approaches. SRU is home for such faculty who are ever curious to question
            existing knowledge, push the boundaries of understanding through research, and incorporate innovative
            teaching- pedagogies for better learning experiences.
            SR University, SR Junior College Warangal, TelanganaCoupled with our exceptional staff, technology-enabled
            infrastructure provides a foundation for entrepreneurial learning through experimentation. Cutting-edge
            technology is embedded in classrooms and laboratories, helping students familiarize themselves with the
            latest technological trends in the market.
            The collaborative entrepreneurial ecosystem provides curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular
            opportunities for everyone to contribute, thrive and create a lasting impact. The system includes strong
            ties with industry and international educational institutions.
